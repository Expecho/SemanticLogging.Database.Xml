# Contributing ffff
We will _consider_ any contributions that align with the goals of the project.

## Housekeeping
Your pull request should:

* Include a description of what your change intends to do.
* Be based on a reasonably recent commit in the `master` branch.
* Include tests covering your changes _as appropriate_.

## Be nice
We might be slower than you'd like. We might also ask you to make changes to the pull request. We ask for your patience.  :smiley:
